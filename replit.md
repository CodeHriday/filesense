# Data File Observatory

## Overview
Data File Observatory is a comprehensive data quality monitoring and observability platform designed for uploading, analyzing, and monitoring data files. It integrates Python-based analytics with a modern web interface to provide advanced quality checks, profiling, and visualization for various file types, ensuring data integrity and offering actionable insights. The platform aims to provide robust data handling, ensuring data integrity and offering insights through a user-friendly interface.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
The application features a hybrid architecture:

-   **Backend**: Python/Streamlit handles data processing, quality analysis (completeness, consistency, validity, uniqueness), and file operations for CSV, JSON, and Parquet, supporting large files with constant memory usage. It includes data profiling and asynchronous processing with memory safeguards.
-   **API Server**: Node.js/Express provides a REST API with JWT authentication, rate limiting, CORS, asynchronous job queues, and an enterprise-grade audit system.
-   **Frontend**: React (TypeScript, Vite) forms a modern single-page application with UI components, Chart.js for visualization, and drag-and-drop file upload functionality.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL stores metadata, user management, file catalogs, and audit logs, optimized with connection pooling and performance indexes.
-   **File Storage**: Local file system with integrated support for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. All file uploads are scanned by ClamAV for viruses.
-   **Caching**: Multi-layer caching with Redis and in-memory fallback for frequently accessed data and API responses, with automatic invalidation.
-   **DBT Integration**: Configured for DBT Core and dbt-postgres for data transformations, including a UI for model discovery, execution, and monitoring.
-   **Security**: ClamAV integration for virus scanning on all uploads, automatic deletion of infected files, role-based access control, and AES-256-CBC encryption for cloud credentials.
-   **Audit System**: Comprehensive, enterprise-grade audit logging across five tables (`audit_log`, `execution_audit`, `data_access_log`, `config_change_history`, `security_audit_log`) with a full-featured UI for viewing and export.
